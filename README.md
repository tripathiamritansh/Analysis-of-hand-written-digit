### Description
Efficient and effective learning of handwritten digits has been an intensive area of research. The paper aims to analyze some of the
studied algorithms using MNIST dataset. We separate our analysis in two parts, the first part will show comparison of accuracies using Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural
Network, Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Descent while the second part will aim at analyzing the effect of feature
descriptor on the accuracies of the applied algorithms. Our analysis on feature extraction will be based on histogram of
oriented gradients (HOG) feature descriptor which is widely used in computer vision and image processing. The main observations
in HOG feature descriptor analysis will be improved accuracies in all four algorithms and faster runtime in SVM and ANN due to
reduction in number of features
